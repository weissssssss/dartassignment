# DART-WEEK-ONE-
Data Types Implementation:

Define Variables: Create a Dart program that defines and initializes variables of the following types: int, double, String, bool, and List.




Type Conversion: Implement functions to:
Convert a String to int and double.
Convert an int to String and double.




Function for Conversion: Write a function convertAndDisplay that:
Takes a String representing a number.
Converts the String to int and double.
Prints the results.




Control Flow:

If-Else Statements: Implement a Dart program that:
Uses if-else statements to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
Uses if-else statements to determine if a person is eligible to vote based on age (must be 18 or older).
Switch Case: Create a program that:
Uses a switch statement to print the day of the week based on a given int (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.).
Loops: Implement the following:
A for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
A while loop that prints numbers from 10 to 1.
A do-while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.




Combining Data Types and Control Flow:

Complex Example: Write a Dart program that:
Defines a List of int numbers.
Uses a for loop to iterate through the list and:
Print each number.
Use if-else statements to check if the number is even or odd.
Implements a switch statement to categorize numbers into "small" (1-10), "medium" (11-100), or "large" (101+).
